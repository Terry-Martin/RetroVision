## Design

### Design Choices
The website was designed to give a "street" feel to the users, which is why a colder colour theme was used. The images of products and skateboarding were used to engage the users.

### Colour
Colour was a very important aspect for engaging with the audience, as anything too childish, or bright may put visitors off. For this reason, I chose to use a nice cold themed colour set for the website, providing a "street" feel. For accessibility reasons, the colours were tested on Webaim using their contrast checker, and the darkest and lightest colours got a contrast ratio of 12.78:1 meaning that they were a great fit.
![Colours image](docs/Colours.png)

### Fonts
The chosen font for the website was "Quicksand", with sans serif as a backup font. I originally also used "Lobster" for headings, but I found that "Quicksand" fitted in much better for my target audience and the feel of the site, so I used a higher weight for the headings to make it appear bolder.

### Structure
To keep the user interface as beginner friendly, and simple as possible, I went for a classic looking nav bar style. It is a simple layout with the logo to the left on desktops, and above on mobile. The theme remains the same throughout all four pages:
- Index page: Shows an image of a skateboarder and why you would choose the company. Also contains the history of the company.
- Tricks page: Gives explanations of how to perform various tricks, enriching the users skateboarding experience. Also has a video for each trick.
- Boards page: Allows the users to see the products that are available.
- Contact page: Gives users a chance to communicate with the company, and also shows a real map displaying where the physical store is.

## Validation

### HTML Validation

The Nu HTML Checker (W3C) is used to validate HTML documents. This ensures that all unintended mistakes are spotted before release, so that they can be corrected. All of my pages passed the check without any errors, including the 404 page.

### CSS Validation

The W3C Jigsaw CSS Validation Service is used in exactly the same way as the Nu HTML Validator, but for CSS. I ran both my actual style.css file, and an actual web page through it, and both passed without any errors.

The website was deployed through the use of GitHub Pages, a feature built in to GitHub. This can be done by following the steps below.
1. In the desired repository, click on "Settings" from the top menu.
2. From the side menu to your left, select "Pages" in the "Code and automation" section.
3. Make sure the "Source" option is set to "Deploy from a branch"
4. Select the desired "Branch" from the drop down below (main branch in most cases, making sure the director is set to /(root)).
5. Select "Save", and after it refreshes the page, you will see a box at the top of the page providing you with the URL of your now published site.

You can fork my, or any other repository by doing the following.
1. Go to the desired repository
2. Click "Fork" in the upper right corner
3. Select the owner, and set the repository name. A description can be added if desired
4. Choose whether to copy the default branch, or all branches
5. Click "Create Form"

You can clone a repository by following the steps below.
1. Go to the desired repository
2. Click the "Code" button at the top of the files section of the page
3. Select your desired method for cloning (HTTPS/SSH/GitHub CLI)
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory
6. Type "git clone", and then paste the URL you copied earlier. It will look like this, with your GitHub username instead of "YOUR-USERNAME": "$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/DESIRED-REPOSITORY"
7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.
