## Design

### Design Choices
The website was designed to give a friendly, engaging tone with our potential customer base.

### Colour
Minimal colours were utilised in this website and were consitent for each page. CHanging colour was used to highligh user actions in nav bar and footer. Images on Listings page were AI generated art with a "Retro" style. Again, that matched the clean, reduced colour number atmosphere. 

### Fonts


### Structure
Each of the 3 webpages was set up with a basic Grid to allow for more simplistic responsivity for different screen sizes by reducing column count for smaller screens. The Header and Footer are consitent for the 3 pages.:
- Index page: Gives a welcome message and explians new features to the relaunched website. Details venue features along with a n image of same. Highlights the three film genres that the cinema concentrates on with three images and text heading.
- Listings page: Shows a list of movies that are showingin current week. Gives the name, running time, age restriction, ticket availability and book ticket option for each movie. Title of movie is external link to its IMBD page. Book Ticket option links to internal Tickets page. Any movie sold out is displayed and does not have Book Ticket option. Background image is computer generated for genre with a design emphasis on retro and fun.
- Tickets page: Allows users to choose which movie they want to see and book it, along with a confirmation. Input fields are validated. Three images of the film genres are showing in rotation, so only one at a time in auto slideshow. Image will pause when mouse hovers on it.
